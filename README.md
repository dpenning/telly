A simple Telnet Wrapper for Python
MIT Liscense 
blah blah blah

For one of my big internship projects, I had to simulate a network engineer moving a service from one device to another device in the core. This seems like it would be pretty easy but as many engies know, there's always going to be some random problem that you run into.

When I decided to use python to write my script I quickly found that there are some finicky little problems with telnet sessions and they felt unavoidable with the telnetlib of python. Because of this, I ended up writing my own telnet wrapper that made it MUCH easier to deal with telnet sessions.

Telly straightens out all of those silly things you have to do with telnet so that you can relax and be sure that your problem isnt that your device logs off randomly or your device is waiting for a command that you cant issue.

I just decided to upload this as of 11/4/13 and it's not a full blown package yet so if you are interested PLEASE contribute!
